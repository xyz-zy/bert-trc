General procedure:
- byte align the source to correct errors during annotation
- load into gate annotation diff
- read the documents and sanity check entity annotations, looking for missing ones and removing generics
- do event merge
- do timex merge
- check all DCT links (if dct = a day, avoid "today X said_e1" "e1 before dct")
- check all timex links and make sure every timex is linked, if possible
- check paragraphs, finding main events linked to dct and check relation between subevents and main events
- validate with Hector's TimeML-validator
- load into CAVaT and check for consistency, using inconsistency discovery points as start point on search for wrong orderings, amending/removing tlinks along the way
- re-validate
- commit
